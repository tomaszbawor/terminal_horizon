A terminal-based roguelike game written in Rust, using the `ratatui` library for its user interface. Explore procedurally generated maps, manage your character, and (eventually) interact with entities within the world.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Main Menu:** Simple menu for starting or quitting the game.
* **Game State Management:** Tracks player stats, map, turn count, and action log.
* **Basic Entities:** Player character representation.

**Planned / In Development:**

* Enemy entities with simple AI (FSM).
* Field of View (FOV) algorithm.
* Combat system.
* Items and inventory.
* More complex map generation and features.
